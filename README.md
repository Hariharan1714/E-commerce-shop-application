Developed a full-stack e-commerce application using Node.js, Express, and Sequelize, with an AWS RDS backend. The application includes the following features:
**User Management: Implemented user authentication and authorization. Users can register, log in, and manage their profiles.
**Product Management: Admin users can add, edit, and delete products. Products are stored in a MySQL database managed via Sequelize.
**Shopping Cart: Implemented a shopping cart system where users can add, update, and remove items. Cart data is associated with users and stored in the database.
**Order Management: Users can place orders and view their order history.
**Database Relationships: Utilized Sequelize to define and manage relationships between users, products, carts,and cart items.
**Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling and custom error pages.
**Views and Templates: Used EJS as the templating engine for dynamic content rendering.
